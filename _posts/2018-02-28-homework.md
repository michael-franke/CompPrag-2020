title: Course requirements & grading 
---

After each session there will be *VIPs*, posted on StudIP. These will be released shortly after the last meeting on each day. Each set of VIPs is due at 9am of the following day.

Additionally, the course requires a *final project*. Groups of three participants will work jointly on a short (maximally 15 minute) video presentation of either a chapter of the problang.org book which was not covered in class /or/ a short research paper on computational pragmatics. The video should explain the main contents of the paper, like a video tutorial would. Spectators should be able to understand the main theoretical point of the paper, the methods used and the main line of argument presented in the paper. If applicable, the video might also contain a short and pointed criticism of the paper. Videos need not be fancy. A simple screencast is more than enough. The content matters more than the presentation style. Nonetheless, well-chosen elements of enhancement that facilitate the transmission of the main content of the video will also be taken into account when judging / grading videos.

The final grade will be an average over individual VIP-score and the final group project where the VIP-scores count for 30%. A passing grade is necessary for both requirements (VIPs and final project) to pass the course.

Here is a [list with topic suggestions](docs/paper-suggestions.pdf) for your final project.
